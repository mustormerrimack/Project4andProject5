This contains Project 4 and 5 for my class at Merrimack College called Software Design and Documentation.
The projects both contain programs that take user input store them in either a linked list or stack data structure and then sorts them.
Each project is in its own self contained folder and has individualized README.md files inside that explain how to operate each program.
This code is currently made available under the permissive MIT license.

The project 4 folder contains the linked list implementation
The project 5 folder contains the stack implementation

Open the folder of the project you would like to use and view the README.md to see how to operate it.
